This is basically an attempted clone of the google site based on the level of proficiency i have in using the django framework.
Here I used my knowledge of web scraping and available free APIs to implement the search functions just like we have in google i.e Web, Images, Videos, News.
It has an operational user authentication system that allow users to sign up, sign in, manage their accounts(viewing profile, editing profile, changing password).
Languages and technologies used here includes;
1. HTML
2. Raw CSS (No bootsrap or any other front-end framework)
3. Javascript (Very little JS is used in this project)
4. Python
5. Python web framework i.e Django
